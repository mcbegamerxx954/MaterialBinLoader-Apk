		<b>MBL2</b></br>
		The well known loader for Minecraft but improved.</br>
		Stable, supports resource packs from both global and world. May not work on certain servers.</br>
		It may break with future Minecraft updates.</br></br>

		<b>Draco</b></br>
		Another loader that works differently and serves as an alternative option.</br>
		Less stable, supports resource packs ONLY from global. Can bypass server restrictions partially.</br>
		Will continue to work for as long Minecraft doesn't get major resource pack related changes.
